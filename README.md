# Welcome to Helios Artistic AI Platform

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID

## Summary

 Helios is a multimodal art education and creation platform that combines gamified learning, live exhibition discovery, community collaboration, and AI-powered creative tools. Powered by Google Gemini (Nano Banana Pro + Veo), it transforms how users learn art history, discover real-world shows, and create remixed masterpieces—all wrapped in a peaceful, therapeutic aesthetic with light pink/blue/purple gradients and gold/silver accents.

 ## Design Archetype
 Soft UI meets Modern Editorial — We're blending the tactile, calming depth of Neumorphism (pastel tones, subtle shadows, pill shapes) with the sophistication of editorial design (cream backgrounds, elegant serif accents, sharp imagery). This creates a sanctuary aesthetic where learning feels meditative, not overwhelming. The UI should feel like flipping through a luxury art book while floating in a cloud.
